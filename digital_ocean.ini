# The module needs your DigitalOcean Client ID and API Key.
# These may also be specified on the command line via --client-id and --api-key
# or via the environment variables DO_CLIENT_ID and DO_API_KEY
#
client_id = <client id>

# API calls to DigitalOcean may be slow. For this reason, we cache the results
# of an API call. Set this to the path you want cache files to be written to.
# One file will be written to this directory:
#   - ansible-digital_ocean.cache
#
cache_path = /tmp


# The number of seconds a cache file is considered valid. After this many
# seconds, a new API call will be made, and the cache file will be updated.
